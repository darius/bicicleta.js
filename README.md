bicicleta.js
============

Kragen's Bicicleta now all in Javascript

Prehistory: https://github.com/darius/ychacks/tree/master/bicicleta
Still to port over: parts of https://github.com/darius/bicicleta.py

## Quick start

Run `make` and open test.html.

## TO DO

(I'm not promising any of this now...)

* more testing/benchmarks
* tune the cruder bits of the runtime
* improve repr/str methods?
* port the compiler
